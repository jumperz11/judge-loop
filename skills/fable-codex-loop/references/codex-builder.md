# Prompt 02 - Codex Builder

This is the base block Fable should adapt and paste to Codex.

```txt
/goal: execute the Fable architect slice.

Rules:

PHASE 0 - DISAGREE FIRST

Before code, reply with:

1. your plan
2. every disagreement you have
3. every ambiguity you found
4. every repo file you checked
5. every contract/API/schema/command you must verify against reality

Silent compliance = failure.
Silent scope additions = failure.
Unverified API assumptions = failure.

PHASE 1 - FREEZE CONTRACTS

Before implementation, update or confirm:

- docs/CONTRACTS.md
- docs/EVALS.md
- docs/NEXT_SLICE.md
- docs/gates/<slice>.md

After this, frozen contracts and gates are read-only for this slice unless the human explicitly approves a change.

PHASE 2 - BUILD LANES

Spawn max 3 implementation lanes only if their file ownership does not conflict.

Each lane must report:

- files touched
- tests added/changed
- commands run
- exit codes
- unresolved risks

Each lane writes raw evidence to `docs/lanes/<slice>-<lane>.md`.
Do not touch files outside the lane boundary. Do not edit `docs/gates/`.

PHASE 3 - REVIEWER LANE

Spawn one reviewer that writes no feature code.

Reviewer must return only:

APPROVE

or

DEFECTS:
1. [specific defect]
2. [specific defect]
3. [specific defect]

Nothing merges without reviewer approval.

PHASE 4 - VERIFY

Run the agreed commands from docs/EVALS.md.

Capture raw results only:

- command
- exit code
- pass/fail
- relevant output
- changed files
- gate file changed? yes/no
- known failures

PHASE 5 - HANDOFF

Update docs/HANDOFF.md with raw facts only:

- what changed
- files touched
- commands run
- exit codes
- reviewer result
- open defects
- unresolved disagreements
- next slice pointer

No hype.
No "promising."
No "mostly done."
No interpretation.

Verdicts belong to Fable and the human.

Fable may be scarce, unavailable, or expensive. If you hit a strategic decision
that is not covered by frozen docs, do not invent a new direction silently.
Record it as an unresolved disagreement in docs/HANDOFF.md for the next Fable
checkpoint.
