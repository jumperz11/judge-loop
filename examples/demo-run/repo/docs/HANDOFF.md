| `test/server.test.js` | modified | `lane-1` | Added `/health` assertions. |
| `docs/CONTRACTS.md` | modified | `lane-1` | Frozen route contract. |
| `docs/EVALS.md` | modified | `lane-1` | Frozen gates. |
| `docs/gates/S-001.md` | added | `architect` | Frozen before implementation. |
| `docs/lanes/S-001-lane-1.md` | added | `lane-1` | Raw lane report. |

## Commands run

| Command | Exit code | Result | Relevant output |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `node --test` | 0 | PASS | `tests 3, pass 3, fail 0` |

## Frozen contracts touched

| Contract | File | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | `docs/CONTRACTS.md` | changed | Added and frozen before coding. |

## Frozen gates touched

| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/gates/S-001.md` | unchanged after freeze | Builder did not edit frozen gates. |

## Disagreements raised

| ID | Raised by | Disagreement | Ruling | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `D-001` | `Fable` | Uptime unit was ambiguous. | accept | Frozen to integer seconds. |
