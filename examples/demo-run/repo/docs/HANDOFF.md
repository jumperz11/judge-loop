## Files changed

| File | Change type | Owner lane | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `test/server.test.js` | modified | `lane-1` | Added `/health` content-type assertion. |
| `docs/EVALS.md` | modified | `lane-1` | Recorded S-002 gate results. |
| `docs/HANDOFF.md` | modified | `lane-1` | Recorded S-002 raw evidence. |
| `docs/lanes/S-002-lane-1.md` | added | `lane-1` | Raw lane report. |

## Commands run

| Command | Exit code | Result | Relevant output |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `npm --prefix examples/demo-run/repo test` | 0 | PASS | `tests 4, pass 4, fail 0` |
| `make validate` | 0 | PASS | `doctor`, demo tests, Python compile, repo validation passed |

## Frozen contracts touched

| Contract | File | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | `docs/CONTRACTS.md` | unchanged | S-002 added test coverage only. |

## Frozen gates touched

| Gate file | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/gates/S-002.md` | unchanged after freeze | Builder did not edit frozen gates. |

## Disagreements raised

| ID | Raised by | Disagreement | Ruling | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `D-002` | `Builder` | Header casing could be brittle. | accept | Used Node's lower-case `res.headers["content-type"]` and regex match. |

## Open defects

| ID | Severity | Defect | Evidence | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BUG-001` | `P2` | Content-type is not explicitly tested. | `test/server.test.js` now asserts it. | Builder | closed |
