# Step 3 - Fable (Review)

## A. VERDICT

**PASS**

## B. RAW EVIDENCE REVIEWED

- `node --test`: 3 passed, 0 failed, exit 0.
- Diff touches only `src/server.js` (no change to `/`).
- Reviewer lane returned `APPROVE`.

## C. GATE RESULTS

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| G-001 `/health` returns 200 | PASS |
| G-002 body matches frozen shape | PASS |
| G-003 `/` unchanged | PASS |

## D. DISAGREEMENT RULINGS

- D-001 (uptime as integer seconds): **accept** - matches frozen contract.

## E. DEFECTS / RISKS

- None blocking. Note: no content-type test asserted; add in a future slice.

## F. KILL / CONTINUE CALL

**Continue.**

## G. NEXT SLICE

- `S-002`: assert `content-type: application/json` on `/health`.

## H. PASTE-READY CODEX BLOCK

```txt
/goal: execute slice S-002 - assert content-type on /health. (same phases)
```
