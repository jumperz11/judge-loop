# Lane Reports

Each builder lane writes one raw report here:

```txt
docs/lanes/S-001-lane-1.md
```

Reports are evidence, not verdicts. They should contain:

- files touched
- commands run
- exit codes
- raw output
- open disagreements
- blockers
- final lane status

The builder reports evidence. Fable gives verdicts. The human decides.

See [`SCHEMA.md`](SCHEMA.md) for the minimal required status format.
