# LLM Builders

The architect model judges. The builder can be any LLM that can implement the
slice and report raw evidence.

Codex is the default builder in this kit because it has a good terminal workflow
and a clean headless path with `codex exec`. It is not required.

## Builder Requirements

A builder must be able to:

1. read repo files
2. disagree before implementation
3. cite real files for assumptions and objections
4. touch only declared files
5. avoid editing frozen gates in `docs/gates/`
6. run verification commands
7. write raw evidence to `docs/HANDOFF.md`
8. write lane reports to `docs/lanes/<slice>-<lane>.md`
9. avoid grading its own work

If an LLM cannot write files directly, it can still be a builder by producing a
patch plus raw verification instructions, but a human or coding tool must apply
and verify it.

## Good Builder Choices

| Builder LLM | Good for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-5.5 Codex | terminal work, tests, long implementation loops | Default path in this kit. |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | careful code reasoning and review-heavy work | Use the same builder contract. |
| GLM 5.2 | cheaper implementation passes or broad code edits | Good if it follows boundaries well. |
| Kimi | large-repo reading and mechanical changes | Keep gates external and raw. |
| DeepSeek | cheap batch implementation and transformations | Keep acceptance gates frozen. |
| Qwen | broad code edits and multilingual codebases | Require exact file boundaries. |
| Any other LLM | whatever it is good or cheap at | It must follow the builder contract. |

## Adapter Template

Paste this after the architect writes the slice:

```txt
You are the BUILDER for this slice.

Architect: [ARCHITECT MODEL].
Judge: architect + human.
Repo docs are memory.

You do not grade your own work.

Before coding:
1. read the listed repo files
2. state your plan
3. state every disagreement or ambiguity
4. cite real files
5. verify APIs, commands, schemas, and formats against reality

During coding:
1. touch only declared files
2. do not edit `docs/gates/`
3. do not add hidden scope
4. run the agreed commands

After coding:
1. update `docs/HANDOFF.md` with raw facts only
2. write `docs/lanes/<slice>-<lane>.md`
3. include commands, exit codes, changed files, and blockers
4. do not claim PASS; verdicts belong to the architect and the human
```

## When To Use Codex-Specific Headless Mode

Use `prompts/04-headless-dispatch.md` only when the builder is Codex CLI.

For every other builder, use the normal manual loop:

```txt
architect prompt -> builder contract -> architect review prompt
```

The loop is model-agnostic. The enforcement comes from repo memory, frozen
gates, lane reports, and human judgment.
