# Reference Gaps

Notes from comparing this kit with `DanMcInerney/architect-loop`.

## Added

| Gap | Added here | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installer | `install.sh`, `install.ps1` | Makes the skill easy to install globally or per project. |
| Package validation | `tests/validate_repo.py`, `make validate` | Catches broken skill metadata, links, and markdown fences before publishing. |
| Runtime scratch area | `.architect/` in `.gitignore` | Gives headless runs a safe place for dispatch blocks, JSONL logs, and worktrees. |
| Frozen gate files | `docs/gates/` | Makes gate tampering easier to detect than one shared eval file alone. |
| Lane reports | `docs/lanes/` | Gives every Codex lane a raw evidence file. |
| Product/research artifacts | `docs/prd/`, `docs/research/` | Keeps research and product decisions out of the handoff file. |
| Headless dispatch guide | `prompts/04-headless-dispatch.md` | Optional path for `codex exec`, worktrees, and unattended lanes. |
| Research checkpoint | `prompts/05-fable-research.md` | Keeps discovery work separate from build work. |

## Intentionally Kept Simpler

| Reference feature | Decision here | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Always architect-owned worktree fan-out | Optional advanced mode | The main audience should succeed with paste-ready Fable + Codex first. |
| Long cited design manifesto | Short README + gap notes | This repo is meant to be a usable kit and post companion, not a research paper. |
| Separate installed research skill | One optional research prompt inside the same kit | Avoids making research feel mandatory for every build slice. |
| Hard dependency on headless `codex exec` | Manual `/goal` mode first | Your original idea is subscription-native and easy to run without automation. |

## Still Worth Adding Later

- A sample `docs/gates/S-001.md` with PASS / FAIL / INVALID rows.
- A JSON schema for lane reports.
- A tiny demo project with actual source and test files, not only docs.
- A publish workflow that creates a GitHub repo and release archive.
